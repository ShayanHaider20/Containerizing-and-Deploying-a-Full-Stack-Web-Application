# Containerizing-and-Deploying-a-Full-Stack-Web-Application
🐳 Dockerized To-Do Application

📌 Project Overview
This project implements a full-stack to-do application with containerized frontend, backend, and database services using Docker. The goal is to enable scalable, portable, and environment-independent deployment with DevOps best practices.

🏗️ Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js ⚛️
Backend: Node.js, Express.js 🚀
Database: MongoDB 🗄️
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Token) 🔑
DevOps Tools: Docker, Docker Hub, Azure ☁️

🚀 Features
✔ User Authentication – Secure JWT-based login & registration.
✔ To-Do Management – Add, update, and delete tasks.
✔ Containerized Deployment – Uses Docker multi-stage builds for optimized images.
✔ Environment Variables Support – Configured with .env for security & flexibility.
✔ CI/CD Integration – Automated deployment with Azure & Docker Hub.
✔ Scalability – Efficient resource utilization via self-terminating containers.

📥 Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/ahmedalisheikh4/dockerized-todo-app.git
cd dockerized-todo-app
2️⃣ Install Dependencies
Go to the frontend and backend directories and run:

cd frontend
npm install
cd backend
npm install
3️⃣ Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file inside the backend directory and add:

MONGO_URI=Your mongodb URI
GMAIL_USERNAME=your gmail address
GMAIL_PASSWORD=password created inside 'App Password' section under google accounts setting
PORT=8000
JWT_SECRET=a random secret key eg. thisisasecretkey
4️⃣ Run the Application
🔹 Start Backend (Express.js & MongoDB)
cd backend
nodemon server
🔹 Start Frontend (React.js)
cd frontend
npm start
🐳 Dockerized Deployment
1️⃣ Build Docker Images
docker-compose build
2️⃣ Run the Containers
docker-compose up -d
The frontend, backend, and MongoDB services run in separate containers.
Containers communicate via Docker network using environment variables.
